<h1>How To Publish a Trial Website</h1>

<ol>
<li>Get write permission from pmackenz. If you don't know how to contact them, you are most likely not part of our team.  </li>
<li>Clone this repository in a folder parallel to your source repository. Clone the
<code>pmackenz/TheDocu6_Playground</code>, do not use a fork!  </li>
<li>Build your website using make html or make TOOL html. This will generate the <code>./build/html</code> or
<code>./build/TOOL/html</code> folder and files.  </li>
<li>Copy the entire contents of your <code>./build/html</code> or <code>./build/TOOL/html</code> folder to
<code>TheDocu6_Playground/docs/.</code>. If that folder contains any files, delete the old ones first such that only your new files are in that folder.  </li>
<li>Add an empty file named TheDocu6_Playground/docs/.nojekyll (no extension, no contents).  </li>
<li>Execute
<div><code>
$ git add . <br>
$ git commit -m "your helpful comment" <br>
$ git push
<code></div>
in TheDocu6_Playground
</li>
<li>Wait for 1-5 minutes and refresh the following link: <a
href="https://pmackenz.github.io/TheDocu6_Playground/">https://pmackenz.github.io/TheDocu6_Playground/</a> </li>
</ol>

You can test your setup locally before step 6. by opening <em>TheDocu6_Playground/docs/index.html</em>-file in your browser.
